		Choose this option to enable locking the DVFS frequency.  If sysfs
		support is enabled files will be created for inspecting and
		(potentially) setting a fixed DVFS frequency.  This is used
		for debugging; enable only if you know what you are doing.

	default n
	help
		Choose this option to enable collecting hardware counter data
		with system trace events.  This is typically used for debugging
		but has minimal overhead when not in use. Enable only if you
		know what you are doing.
